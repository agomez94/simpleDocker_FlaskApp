# Creating a Docker Image with Flask: Step-by-Step Guide

## This guide provides a step-by-step process for creating a Docker image for a Flask application. Docker allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a portable container, ensuring consistency across different environments. By following this guide, you will have a Docker image that runs a Flask application, ready for deployment.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.11.3 or a compatible version installed

Docker desktop installed on your system

### Steps

1. Checking Python Version: Verify that Python is installed and check the version.
 
2. Setting Up the Environment: Set up a virtual environment for your project.

3. Installing Flask: Install Flask and its dependencies inside the virtual environment.
 
4. Freezing Dependencies: Freeze the installed dependencies into a requirements.txt file.

5. Creating the Flask Application: Create a simple Flask application to test the Docker image.

6. Creating a .dockerignore File: Exclude unnecessary files and directories from being copied into the Docker image.

7. Creating the Docker Image: Define the Docker image using a Dockerfile with instructions.

8. Building the Docker Image: Build the Docker image based on the Dockerfile instructions.

9. Running the Docker Container: Run a Docker container based on the created image.

10. Testing the Dockerized Flask Application: Access the application in your browser to verify it's running correctly.

11. Stopping the Docker Container: Stop the running Docker container.

12. Removing the Docker Container: Remove the stopped Docker container.

13. Deleting the Docker Image: Delete the Docker image created for the Flask application.

14. Cleaning Up Unused Docker Resources: Remove any other unused Docker resources using the Docker system prune command.
